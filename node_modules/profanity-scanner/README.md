# Profanity Scanner

This is a very small, and simple profanity scanner that scans for 700+ isolated words. This is not intended to be used as a robust profanity filter, but as a warning mechanism that a string of text might need to be approved or reviewed by a human before it's published.

### Example Usage

```js
var pf = new Profanity_Scanner()
pf.scan('hello there!') // returns false
pf.scan('stfu.') // returns true

pf.add_word('noobie') // returns true if added
pf.remove_word('noobie') // returns true if removed
```
